                <h2>What Is Repetition?</h2>
                <p>In the world of web design, repetition simply means to repeat certain aspects or elements in a design.
                </p>
                <h2>Why Should I Use Repetition?</h2>
                <p>Having repeating elements in a website’s design can help to unify the design, and improve the user’s experience.
                </p>
                <h2>Common Examples of Repetition</h2>
                <p>A company’s logo is often repeated on each page of their website, in the same place, on every page. Logos are usually clickable, and often, clicking on a logo will bring you back to the main page of a website.

                <img src="presentation_imgs/youtube.png" alt='youtube logo'>
                <p>Many companies put a navigation bar in the same place on every page of their website. This allows users to easily be able to move between the pages.

                <p>Many websites use repetition in their color scheme.</p>

                <img src='presentation_imgs/colortheme.png' alt='website screenshot'>
                <p>Fonts, shapes, and textures are also common elements of a website that are often repeated.

                <p>One other thing that repetition is used for, is the reinforcement of a message. By seeing a message that is repeated over and over again, users are more likely to remember it.
