                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. What are their demographics?</strong>
                    <br/> -Age: 16-85 years old
                    <br/> -Income: Varies between customers
                    <br/> -Education: Varies between customers
                    <br/> -Geographic Location: In the United States and 59+ other countries
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>2. How did the site meet the needs of the visitor?</strong>
                    <br/> The site met the needs of the visitor by providing him with access to his bank account balances and statements, and allowing him the option to use the Chase QuickPay feature to transfer money to someone if needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>3. Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.</strong>
                    <br/> There was not too much content in the customer's way on the website to the point that it overwhelmed him with information, so that was helpful. The login page was easily accessible from the homepage, and it took the visitor right to his account balances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>4. What did the site do to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)?</strong>
                    <br/> The site placed a navigation bar on the mobile version which is always there no matter where their visitors are on a page to help them return to the main pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>5. Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment? If "Yes", how?</strong>
                    <br/> Yes, the site made it very simple for people in a mobile environment to access the information that they want/need quickly. The sign in button is the first thing that you see next to the Chase logo. There is also a menu option that visitors can access quickly which changes the site's language to Spanish, in case they need to do that. Another thing that is easily accessible which is very helpful, is the link to search for the nearest ATM.

                </figure>

                <p>
                    <strong>Explanation of Screenshot: </strong><br/>This page, which is the homepage, did a great job of meeting the visitor needs because the links to the most commonly accessed pages, such as the sign in page, the ATM locator, and the account balances page, were easily accessible and findable. There was also added information for new customers and for current customers looking to get a new debit card or a new credit card.

                <p>
                    <strong>1. Did they or did they not know who their target audience was?</strong>
                    <br/> Yes. This site is the blog that I made for my Visual Media class, actually. I've posted all of my assignments thus far for my teacher and fellow classmates to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience?</strong>
                    <br/> Yes, I did meet the needs of my audience. My audience goes on my blog to see my assignments once they're completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found?</strong>
                    <br/> Yes, the content is in order by the date that it was added, and the audience is familiar with the order of the projects that we've done so far in our class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>4. Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment?</strong>
                    <br/> Yes, but there were some issues with paragraphs and sentences being split up by images, and the page turned partially black for a few seconds when zooming in and then zooming out.
