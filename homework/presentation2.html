        <h2>Here we are referring to the title and alt attributes of the "img" tag in an HTML document</h2>
        <p>The title and alt attributes are sometimes referred to as the title and alt tags, even though they're not technically tags.</p>
        <h3>What do these attributes look like when written in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <img src="presentation_imgs/img_tag.jpg" alt="This is an example which demonstrates how to write the HTML image tag with title and alt attributes" title="The title attribute is what is making this tooltip appear">
        <h3>What is the HTML title attribute?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shown as a tooltip when the user hovers over the element with their mouse</li>
            <li>Could contain an extra call-to-action</li>
            <li>Not required, but it can be useful to include</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the HTML alt attribute?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Describes the image</li>
            <li>Describes the function of the image on the page</li>
            <li>Used by screen readers to let blind and visually impaired users know what the image is</li>
            <li>Used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</li>
            <li>Sometimes referred to as alt text</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why do I need to know about these image attributes?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The alt attribute is important for SEO</li>
            <li>The alt attribute is important for accessibility purposes</li>
            <li>Blind and visually impaired users won't know what your images are for without an alt attribute</li>
            <li>The title attribute can provide additional useful information to the user</li>
            <li>"Google places a relatively high value on alt texts to determine what is on the image but also to determine the topic of surrounding text."</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What if an image on my page is purely for design purposes?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If possible, images that are purely for design purposes should be in your CSS</li>
            <li>If that's not possible, then you can give the image an empty alt attribute, which will cause screen readers to skip over it</li>
            <li>An empty alt attribute looks like this:</li>
        </ul>
        <img src='presentation_imgs/blank_alt.jpg' alt="This is an example of how to write an image tag with an empty alt attribute in HTML" title="An image with an empty alt attribute will be skipped over by screen readers">
        <h3>Tips for writing good alt text</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An alt attribute should be fairly long and descriptive - a short sentence</li>
            <li>If a keyword would be useful for finding the image, include it in the alt attribute if you can</li>
        </ul>
