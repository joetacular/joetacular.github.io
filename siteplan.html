                <ul>
                    <li>I will make sure that my site’s load-time is reasonable by sizing the images appropriately so that they can load quickly and still be seen easily.</li>
                    <li>I will make sure that I use contrasting colors for my text/background so that it will be easy to read the text.</li>
                    <li>I will make sure that my font size/spacing makes the content easy to read by testing my site to see what it looks like on various screen sizes.</li>
                    <li>I will give my images appropriate ALT tags so that they are identifiable by people using screen-readers.</li>
                    <li>The title of my site will be clearly visible on the homepage and on the other pages of the site.</li>
                    <li>The navigation links will be clearly labeled, it will be easy to click on them, and it will be easy to tell when the mouse is hovering over them.</li>
                    <li>There will be a logo near the top of all of the pages that will link to the homepage.</li>
                    <li>The headings on the site will be clear and concise.</li>
                    <li>The main copy will be short and concise since this site is geared toward children.</li>
                    <li>Each page will have a title that will help the user to easily be able to identify the page that they have open in their browser tabs.</li>
