                    <p>
                        <!--Why are we building this weather site? What is its purpose? It should take less than 30 seconds to read this-->
                        The main reason that I am building this website is so that people can have a reliable source to go to to find information about the weather. Its purpose is to provide people with up to date weather information so that they can plan accordingly. The other content on the website will serve the purpose of educating users about various weather-related news and topics.

                        Name of the reviewer: Shaelyn Rich<br>
                        The peer feedback: "I like that you can tell that it is the same website between all of the devices. My only comment would be that the small screen might be too crammed. I would suggest maybe moving the images/videos and footer down so that the user would just have to scroll to get that information."<br>
                        My response to the peer feedback: I took Shaelyn's advice and moved the images/video and footer down on the mobile device sketches. It does look less crammed now!
